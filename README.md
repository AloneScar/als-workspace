Emmmm, this project is tailor-made for alonescar because of some of his strange ailments.
So wish him happy.

- [ ] Automatic installation, such as system, tools, etc.
- [ ] Monitor the modification of the configuration file and update it remotely in time
- [ ] There should be some installation tutorials, process records and the like

The project should include script instead of setting files.
